# German Inflation Model and Forecasting

After more than a decade of struggling with the mystery of the missing inflation, central banks are now facing the opposite problem: inflation is back in the game. The recent rise in inflation reflects the goods-intensive economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic which supply has not been able to fully meet. In addition, the high-inflation environment has been bolstered by the highly accommodative fiscal and monetary policies that took place around the globe. In such a scenario, real-time precise inflation forecasts are of the utmost importance for monetary policy and investment strategies. 

* Data: 
- CPI inflation (index)
- Industrial production (index)
- Orders received by industry (index)
- Interest rates based on the 3-month interbank rate (annual percent)

* Period: 1991M1 to 2022M3

* Method: Multivariate Time Series Analysis

In here I try to investigate the inflation dynamics in Germany and conduct an out-of-sample forecasting exercise.

I include Matlab-notebook and published PDF notebook.
